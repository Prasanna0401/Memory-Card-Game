# Memory Game

## Description
The Memory Game is a fun and interactive game where the player needs to flip over cards to find matching pairs. The game is played by flipping two cards at a time and checking if they match. If the cards match, they remain face-up; if not, they are flipped back over. The goal is to find all matching pairs in the shortest time possible.

This version of the game is built using HTML for the structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for the game logic.

## Features
- A grid of cards that players can flip.
- Matching pairs of cards that will remain face-up once found.

## How to Play
1. Click on any card to flip it over.
2. Try to match pairs of cards with the same picture.
